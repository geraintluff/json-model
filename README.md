# JSON Models

This project defines a wrapper for JSON data, adding events, JSON Schema (validation/assignment), and bindings to HTML (server-side) and DOM (browser).

## Code-generation for validation

As well as the generic container, this project can generate validation code (and also basic JavaScript classes) from JSON Schemas.  Since a single schema is often validated against multiple instances, this is more efficient than parsing the schema each time
